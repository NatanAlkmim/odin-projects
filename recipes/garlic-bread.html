        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Brazilian garlic bread, or "p達o de alho", is a popular side dish
            served at barbecues (churrascos) throughout Brazil. Unlike
            traditional garlic bread, it's usually made with small rolls or
            baguettes filled with a creamy garlic spread, often mixed with butter,
            mayonnaise, and sometimes cheese or herbs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Grilled over charcoal until crispy on the outside and soft on the
            inside, "p達o de alho" adds a rich, savory flavor to any cookout. It's
            a favorite appetizer that pairs perfectly with grilled meats and
            is loved for its bold taste and irresistible aroma.
